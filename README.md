### About me

Hi, I'm Will: a theoretician turned technician. Six years of experience as an analytic philosphy PhD specialising in the aesthetics of speculative fiction pursuaded me to help build the future as well as imagine it.
I'm a recent bootcamp graduate who specialised in data and cloud engineering, primarily through learning Python and SQL (SQLite and Postgres). Specialised DE tools that I'm familiar with incude Pandas, NumPy, PySpark, 
Kafka and Airflow. I also have a good working knowledge of AWS DE tools (EC2, S3, MWAA, MSK, API Gateway). Ask me anything about my many interets: wiritng, SF and fantasy literature, music, climibing and philosophy.
